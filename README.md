# EfficientEstimationDSGE

This repository contains MATLAB code accompanying the paper  
**"Efficient Estimation of Nonlinear DSGE Models"**  
by *Eva Janssens* and *Sean McCrary*.

Each subdirectory implements a specific model with its own estimation or filtering routine. The general structure of the filtering procedure alternates between:

1. **Solution Step**: Solves the model locally at the current state forecast.
2. **Filtering Step**: Constructs state-space matrices consistent with the current local solution and performs a single step of the time-varying Kalman filter.

Each subdirectory contains a dedicated `README.md` with details on the model, data, and estimation or filtering demonstration.
