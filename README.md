# EfficientEstimationDSGE

This repository provides MATLAB implementations for efficient full-information estimation of **nonlinear DSGE models** using projection methods, symbolic computation, and Bayesian inference. Each subdirectory contains a self-contained model application, illustrating how to estimate complex macroeconomic models using modern solution and filtering techniques.
