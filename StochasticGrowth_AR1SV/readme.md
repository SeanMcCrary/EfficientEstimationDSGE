# Stochastic Growth Model with Stochastic Volatility

This repository contains MATLAB code for a **stochastic growth model** with **stochastic volatility** in productivity. The model is solved using Taylor projection and estimated using two filtering approaches:

1. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)  
2. Discretized filter for latent volatility

## Overview

- Productivity follows an AR(1) process with stochastic volatility (log-AR(1)).
- Policy functions are solved via a Newton method.
- Filtering recovers latent states and regime probabilities from simulated data.
